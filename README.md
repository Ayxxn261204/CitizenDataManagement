Citizen Data Management System
Language: C | Data Structure: Singly Linked List

Designed and implemented a console-based system to manage citizen records efficiently using dynamic memory allocation and singly linked lists. 
The system supports CRUD operations—adding, modifying, deleting, and searching citizen records—without relying on static arrays, ensuring scalability. 
Each citizen node stores details like name, age, gender, and address. Integrated data validation, user-friendly menus, and modular functions for clean and maintainable code. Demonstrated strong understanding of pointer manipulation, memory management, and structured programming in C.
